# AskSusi

A small Slack bot I wrote in around an hour. Uses the Susi API on which I'm currently working on for another project, and the RTM API for using with Slack. I'm also working on a Node version for the same.

More about Susi: http://asksusi.com

On your ```virtualenv```, install the requirements using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Set up a bot on Slack and add the token in the config file, and set the ```botname``` in ```asksusi.py```.

Run the app using ```python asksusi.py```.

TODO: Write this in Flask and deploy it.
